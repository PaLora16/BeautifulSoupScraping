## Beautiful soup scraping example
Data is often retrieved from external sources using APIs. However, not all APIs (in fact, almost all) are free, and not every data source has a corresponding API. An alternative source of external data is web scraping, an old technology that allows traversing raw HTML for required data. Of course, each HTML is different and can change without notice - but data are free (don't want to get into copyright issues). Several Python packages provide web scraping services, such as scrapy https://scrapy.org/ or  Beautiful Soup https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest. A shallow learning curve is one of the beauties of Beautiful Soup. To demonstrate how Beautiful soup works, I prepared a demo that scrapes actual currency exchange rates from https://www.exchange-rates.org/". The scrappy solutions are tightly-coupled to resourcing HTML, but writing defense code can warn if the data format changes or the values are outside the expected range. Real-world applications would have more monitoring code than this demo, but the ease with which you can scrape HTML with Beautiful soup is astounding,
